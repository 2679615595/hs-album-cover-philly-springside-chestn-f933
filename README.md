### HTML Album Cover
<img src="https://after-school-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/happy.gif" width="300px" align="right" hspace="10"> Pharrel isn't quite happy, he needs some help coding the album cover for his hit song "Happy." His dev chops aren't quite as skilled as yours, so he's hired you to take care of business.

Pharrel did provide us with some specs for the design of the album, found in `MOCKUP.jpg`. You can't view a jpg in terminal, so make sure you open it with a photo viewer like Preview.

Pharrel also provided us with the text for the album and all the legal mumbo-jumbo to give credit where credit is due. You can find that text in `SOURCE.md`. Each line of text in this file corresponds to a line you'll write in `index.html`.

### Get To Werk
Write your code in `index.html`. Keep that file open in both Sublime Text (to make changes to the HTML) and the browser (to see if your changes worked). Use the comments found in that file to help you determine which HTML tags to use.
